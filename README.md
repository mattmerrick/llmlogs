## 🎯 Goal

Help creators, founders, writers, and indie hackers get their websites and content ranked and referenced inside large language models (LLMs), where more and more users are searching for answers.

## 🧠 Why LLM Rankings Matter

- Over 1B+ prompts are generated daily with AI tools
- Tools like Perplexity, Bing Copilot, and ChatGPT (with browsing) pull live data from websites
- LLMs are becoming the new search engines — and most people aren't optimizing for them (yet)
