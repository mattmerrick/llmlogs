                        <p>BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. You will often see BERT used to help computers understand language more like humans do.</p>
                        <p>With BERT, you can improve tasks like question answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis. BERT looks at the words before and after a target word, which lets it understand meaning from all directions.</p>
                        <p>BERT was created by Google and became well known in 2018. It led to many versions and improvements over time. You may notice that many popular language tools use BERT in their systems.</p>
                        <p>BERT is helpful if you want strong results and speed on common natural language tasks. It is not as big as some newer models, so it can run on less powerful computers.</p>
                        <p>Many businesses still use BERT for daily language needs because it is <a href="https://snorkel.ai/large-language-models/bert-models/">reliable and proven</a>. Its design also made it easy for groups to create their own models by fine-tuning BERT for special tasks.</p>
                        <p>You do not need huge amounts of data to fine-tune BERT. This makes it a practical choice for lots of language problems.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Large Language Models</h2>
                    <p>Large language models (LLMs) are a core tool in artificial intelligence. They help you work with text-based data in powerful new ways by generating, analyzing, and understanding human language at scale.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card" id="how-llms-work">
                        <h3>How Large Language Models Work</h3>
                        <p>LLMs rely on deep learning, a method in machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. These networks are trained on huge amounts of text from books, articles, websites, and more. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence, which helps it understand grammar, context, and meaning.</p>
                        <p>Each time you give an LLM a prompt, it analyzes the input using patterns it has seen before. It then generates a response that is likely to make sense given the context. The size of the model—measured by the number of parameters—affects its ability to handle complex language tasks.</p>
                        <p>Some of the most well-known LLMs include OpenAI's GPT models and Google's PaLM. These models can be found in many applications and services today. You can read more about how these models work and are trained on the <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-large-language-models-work-91c362f5b78f">Medium guide on large language models</a>.</p>

                    <div class="card" id="applications">
                        <h3>Common Applications of LLMs</h3>
                        <p>LLMs are used in many everyday tools and platforms. For example, they power chatbots, virtual assistants, translation apps, and autocomplete features. You might see them used for writing emails, summarizing text, answering questions, or generating ideas.</p>
                        <p>In business, LLMs help automate customer service, draft documents, and analyze large amounts of text data. They also support researchers by quickly scanning and extracting information from articles. In education, students use LLMs for tutoring, study help, or language learning.</p>
                        <p>These models are especially valuable when you need to process or generate natural language with high accuracy.

                    <h2>Key Factors for Evaluating LLMs</h2>
                    <p>When choosing a large language model, it is important to focus on how well it gives correct answers and how easily you can use it in different situations. Clear measures can help you understand which model fits your needs best.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card" id="accuracy">
                        <h3>Accuracy and Performance</h3>
                        <p>You need to check if the LLM provides accurate and reliable answers. Look at performance on benchmark tests and real-world tasks, such as answering questions or generating summaries. Task-specific evaluation is important because some models do better at certain things, like translation or code completion.</p>
                        <p>Consider key metrics like fluency, coherence, relevance, and context awareness. These show how natural and meaningful the responses are. Evaluate the model's ability to follow instructions and handle complex queries. You might also want to see how the model handles different languages and responds to edge cases.</p>
                        <p>A good practice is to use both automatic and human evaluations. <a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/strategies-for-evaluating-llms/">Comparing LLMs</a> on public leaderboards and your own custom tests gives a complete view of their strengths and weaknesses. Make sure to test against factual information and current knowledge, not just general language ability.</p>

                        <h3>Scalability and Deployment Options</h3>
                        <p>Scalability means how well an LLM can handle more data or serve more users while keeping performance steady. Some models are easy to deploy on your own servers or in the cloud, while others may have stricter requirements or higher costs.</p>
                        <p>Check for deployment options that match your technical resources, such as on-premises, private cloud, or public cloud. Flexible deployment is key if you have security or compliance needs.</p>
                        <p>Look at how easy it is to tune or update the model as your needs change. Support for fine-tuning, monitoring, and model updates can help you get the most value. Teams should review <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/llm-evaluation-framework-best-practices/">contextual awareness, topic relevancy, and security</a> to make sure the deployment fits your use case.</p>
                        <p>You should also consider the pricing model, support, and documentation. These factors affect how smoothly you can scale the system and maintain it over time.</p>
