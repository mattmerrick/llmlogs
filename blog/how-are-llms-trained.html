                <p>Large language models (LLMs) are at the core of new advances in artificial intelligence, making tools like GPT possible. <strong>LLMs are trained using huge datasets, advanced algorithms, and massive computing power to help them understand and generate human-like text.</strong> Training involves several steps, including self-supervised learning and reinforcement from human feedback, all to make the models better at understanding and responding to your questions.</p>
                <p>By learning from billions of sentences, LLMs get better at tasks like answering questions, writing stories, and more. Training a single LLM often takes thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) running in parallel, as seen with models that have over 500 billion parameters, such as Google's PaLM model. You can read about these methods in detail on <a href="https://www.run.ai/guides/machine-learning-engineering/llm-training">how LLMs are trained</a>.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LLMs are trained using massive datasets and powerful computers.</li>
                    <li>Training steps include self-supervised and supervised learning.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>What Are Large Language Models?</h2>
                <p>Large language models (LLMs) are advanced computer programs that use large sets of text to understand and generate human language. These models rely on deep learning and special architectures to process data efficiently and handle challenging language tasks. To learn more about how these models work, check out our guide on <a href="/blog/how-do-llms-work.html">how LLMs work</a>.</p>

                <h3>Types of Language Models</h3>
                <p>Language models come in different types, each with unique strengths. The simplest ones, called <em>n-gram models</em>, predict words by looking at a few previous words. They're fast but can't remember much context.</p>
                <p>Neural language models, including LLMs, use neural networks to learn patterns from huge text datasets. This allows them to consider more context and generate more accurate text. The most powerful models today are based on the <em>transformer architecture</em>, which processes words in parallel instead of just one-by-one.</p>
                <p>Most LLMs, like GPT or BERT, are built to handle many tasks. These include writing text, answering questions, or even translating languages. Training often uses self-supervised learning and vast sources like Wikipedia, books, or websites. For a deeper understanding of different model types, see our <a href="/blog/best-llms.html">guide to the best LLMs</a>.</p>

                <h3>Transformer Architecture</h3>
                <p>LLMs rely on the transformer model, which broke important ground in natural language processing. The transformer uses a mechanism called <em>attention</em> to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence, making it possible to understand relationships between wordsâ€”even if they're far apart.</p>
                <p>The model uses <strong>layers</strong> of attention and feedforward steps to process information. This parallel structure lets LLMs analyze large amounts of text quickly. Transformers have replaced older types of neural networks in many language tasks.</p>
                <p>Key features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-attention: finds connections between all words in a sentence.</li>
                    <li>Scalability: can train on billions of words or more.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility: adapts to many language tasks without major changes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more details on how transformers work, check out our <a href="/guides/llm-optimization/core-concepts.html">core concepts guide</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Training Process for LLMs</h2>
                <p>Training large language models uses deep learning to analyze huge text datasets. This process helps LLMs learn how to predict and generate language by adjusting the model's internal parameters through many steps. Each phase plays a key role in making the model accurate and useful.</p>

                <h3>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h3>
                <p>First, you need a large and diverse <strong>training dataset</strong>. This dataset usually comes from sources like books, websites, news articles, and social media. The larger and more varied your data, the better your model will be at understanding different topics and writing styles.</p>
                <p>Next, the data must be cleaned and standardized. Common steps include removing personal information, fixing typos, and filtering out unwanted material. Preprocessing also breaks text into pieces like words or subwords. These pieces are converted into numbers so the model can use them during training.</p>
                <p>Data quality is very important. If the data contains mistakes, the model may develop poor language habits. Well-prepared data ensures the model can generate clear and relevant responses when given new prompts.</p>

                <h3>Pre-Training Methods</h3>
                <p>Pre-training is when you expose the LLM to massive amounts of text data for the first time. You do not teach it about any task directly. Instead, the model tries to predict the next word in a sentence using everything it has seen so far. This helps the model learn about grammar, facts, and context.</p>
                <p>A key feature in pre-training is the use of <strong>self-attention</strong> mechanisms. Self-attention helps the model focus on the most important words in a sentence, no matter where they are. This is important for understanding meaning and context over long passages of text.</p>
                <p>The model learns from its mistakes at each step. It slowly adjusts its weights so its predictions become more accurate with each round of training.</p>

                <h3>Fine-Tuning and Adaptation</h3>
                <p>After pre-training, you can fine-tune the model for specific tasks or domains. This process is crucial for making the model more useful in real-world applications. For a detailed guide on fine-tuning, see our article on <a href="/blog/fine-tuning-llms.html">fine-tuning LLMs</a>.</p>
                <p>Fine-tuning involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using smaller, task-specific datasets</li>
                    <li>Adjusting model parameters for better performance</li>
                    <li>Implementing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This step helps the model become more accurate and relevant for specific use cases, as explained in our <a href="/guides/llm-optimization/content-optimization.html">content optimization guide</a>.</p>

                <h2>Key Components of Model Training</h2>
                <p>You need to understand how large language models process data, adjust their inner settings, and manage sequences of information. The way you choose and control certain settings can have a big impact on how well the model works.</p>

                <h3>Parameters and Hyperparameters</h3>
                <p>Parameters are the values changed by the model during training. These include millions or even billions of tiny weights and biases in the neural network. <em>Parameters</em> are what the model "learns" from its training data, helping it make accurate predictions.</p>
                <p><em>Hyperparameters</em> are set before training. These include the learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and number of attention heads. Hyperparameters control the training process itself and have a big influence on performance and stability. Tuning hyperparameters often requires lots of testing and can be different for each model.</p>

                <h3>Attention Mechanism</h3>
                <p>Attention is a method that helps the model figure out which words in a sentence are most important. It lets the model look at many words at once and decide which ones matter. This is important for understanding context and for answering questions in a detailed way.</p>
                <p>Self-attention, used in transformer architectures, gives each word in a sentence a score based on how much it relates to the other words. The model weighs the connections, making it possible to handle grammar, order, and meaning more effectively.</p>

                <h2>Applications of Trained LLMs</h2>
                <p>Trained large language models (LLMs) allow you to generate natural language, solve complex tasks, and support users in real-world applications. You can use LLMs for content creation, accurate language translation, and responsive chat experiences.</p>

                <h3>Text Generation and Summarization</h3>
                <p>With LLMs, you can create text that sounds natural and clear. This is helpful in writing articles, product descriptions, and emails. Businesses may use LLMs to create reports or generate code, saving you time and effort.</p>
                <p>LLMs are effective in summarizing long documents or articles. You can get brief and focused summaries without losing critical information. In education, this helps students understand large reading materials more quickly.</p>

                <h3>Language Translation</h3>
                <p>LLMs can translate text between many languages with higher quality than many older tools. You can use LLMs to chat with friends, coworkers, or customers who speak a different language.</p>
                <p>Language translation from LLMs supports business communication, technical documentation, and customer service needs. The use of LLMs in real-time translation is common in global meetings and support centers.</p>

                <h3>Conversational AI and Chatbots</h3>
                <p>When you interact with a modern chatbot, the technology behind it is likely an LLM. These conversational AI systems, like ChatGPT, can answer questions, help with technical support, or guide you through health and education topics.</p>
                <p>In customer service, LLM-powered chatbots are available day and night to handle basic questions or route you to a human agent when needed. This reduces wait times and allows support teams to handle more requests efficiently.</p>
